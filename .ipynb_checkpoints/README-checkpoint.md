# Housing-price-prediction

### Housing price prediction using Linear and Polynomial Regression.

In the jupyter notebook named "Polynomial regression", we have predicted the housing prices using Polynomial Regression but with using the machinery of Linear Regression. 
Likewise, in the jupyter notebook named "Linear Regression", we have predicted the housing prices using Linear Regression and in additon we have also created a test set to see it's accuray which turned out to be around 55%.
