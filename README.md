# Housing-price-prediction

### Housing price prediction using Linear and Polynomial Regression.

In the jupyter notebook named "Polynomial Regression", we have predicted the housing prices using Polynomial Regression but with using the machinery of Linear Regression. 
Likewise, in the jupyter notebook named "Linear Regression", we have predicted the housing prices using Linear Regression and in additon we have also created a test set in both of the notebooks using Sci-kit Learn to see their accuracy.

I have also used graphs to visualize the data for our better understanding.

# Evaluation
## Linear Regression
 **Training set accuracy** - 57%
 
 **Test set accuracy** - 55%


## Polynomial Regression
 **Training set accuracy** - 68%
 
 **Test set accuracy** - 64%




## As we can see Polynomial Regression works much better as we are not limited to fit data on a straight line.
